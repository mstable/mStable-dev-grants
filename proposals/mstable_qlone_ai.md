## Development Roadmap

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.
Below we provide an example roadmap. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to mStable.
For each milestone:
Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

### Community engagement

A Medium article will be published which will explain how our app was developed and features of it.

## Future Plans

We will acquire users with our growth model for 1 year, we will offer better pricing with our tools which other projects lack. Our strategy is user acquisition using our marketing plan and go-to-market strategy. We will focus on user acquisition and revenue for first year. Marketing plan: Affiliate marketing, referral systems, ad words, seo, smm (social media marketing twitter, instagram, tiktok and etc..), Kols (influencers), partnership promotions.
Another important marketing milestone is token IDO through numerous launchpads which will give instant token/NFT holders and users. We have great connections with numerous tier 1 launchpads.
