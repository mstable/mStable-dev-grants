# General Grant Proposal

* **Project:** Moonshot Commons

## Project Overview
If this application in response to an RFP then please indicate this on the first line of this section.

### Overview
Moonshot Commons is a vibrant, Gen-Z Web3 builder community dedicated to fostering innovation in the blockchain and Web3 domain. We host biannual month-long Web3 hackathons, in December and June, to support and encourage creators in developing new Web3 ideas. Our community has over 1,000 members globally, and we have successfully assisted more than 40 founders in transforming their ideas into venture-backed projects. By partnering with top-tier VCs and industry-leading founders, we aim to provide a robust platform for the development and launch of groundbreaking Web3 projects.

### Project Details

Since our inception in 2021, we have expanded to over 1,000 members worldwide, providing a strong support network for innovative projects in the blockchain and Web3 space. 

We have successfully organized 8 hackathons so far. In last year solely, we organized two Moonshot Web3 Hackathons, one in summer and the other in winter. During the Summer Hackathon, we interviewed 523 teams, invited 45 to participate, and saw 25 of them demo their products. Of these, 70% received seed funding from top venture capital firms. In the Winter Hackathon, we received 221 applications, invited 52 teams, and 22 of them participated in the final Demo Day, pitching their products to more than 100 VCs.

We continue to empower Gen-Z Web3 founders from day 0, firmly believing that the next groundbreaking innovations will emerge from this generation.

### Team's experience
Please describe the team's relevant experience.
Our team possesses the ideal combination of experience, trust, and a proven track record, making us the right people to build and nurture the Moonshot Commons ecosystem. Before embarking on the Moonshot journey, we co-founded an online education platform called Peer Insight Education, which focused on teaching standardized tests. From 2017 to 2021, we successfully ran the company together and eventually sold it to Vision Education.

This prior experience of working together as a team has enabled us to develop a strong foundation of trust and collaboration. We understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, and know how to leverage our collective skills to achieve success. This established synergy gives us an edge over the competition, as our team is well-equipped to handle the challenges and opportunities that come with nurturing and supporting the Gen-Z Web3 founders community through Moonshot Commons and our hackathons.
