## Development Roadmap

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to mStable.

For each milestone:

* Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
* Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
* Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  Workload of an employed person ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent))
* **Total Costs:** Amount of Payment for the whole project. The total amount of funding needs to be below $50k.

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement mStable SDK
* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  1
* **Costs:** $5,000

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) create mUSD using our application. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests |
| 1. | mStable SDK module: X | We will create an mStable SDK module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone) |
| 2. | mStable SDK module: Y | We will create an mStable SDK module that will... |
| 3. | Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our SDK |

### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features
...

### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we require that you produce an article/tutorial and publish it (for example on [Medium](https://medium.com/)). It should explain your work done as part of the grant.

Normally, we ask you to submit the write-up upon the completion of your grant, although for larger projects it might make sense to publish multiple articles after the completion of different milestones.

## Future Plans
Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions.

## Additional Information
Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application that hasn't already been included.

Possible additional information to include:
* What work has been done so far?
* Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?
* Have you applied for other grants so far?
