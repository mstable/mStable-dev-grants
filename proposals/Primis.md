# General Grant Proposal

* **Project:** Primis

## Project Overview
Primis is aimed to be the best known the **Web3 Desktop** world. 



### Overview

Primis redefines the **Web3 Desktop** world. 

In here, a basic Web3 explorer will be provided. Primis integrates all Dapps in the Web3 world and interacts Dapps with blockchains through a simple operation interface. 

Compared to hosting Dapps on the traditional Web 2.0 cloud server, now Dapps can be directly installed on nodes through a plug-in. Primis provides decentralized network services and multi-chain adaptation. Smart contracts record access point information and offer a self-updating, security, and fast method to upgrade services. 

Primis was born with the Web3 wallet, and it created a privacy-encrypted Web3 ‘Discord’ by integrating P2P communication protocols and Zero-Knowledge Proof. Unlike the traditional Web2 chatting method, Primis provides secure privacy interaction, communication, community DAO governance, and voting through multi-channels, blogs, and open forums. 

#### Core Components ####

* Primis Wallet
Basic functions like managing Web3 wallet assets, showing NFT assets data, and offering other Dapp assets information. Primis Wallet also supports managing fortress assets based on ZK privacy technology. 


* P2P Communication Protocol
The protocol supports Primis users to start P2P encrypted chats and create P2P encrypted group chats.

* Primis Web3 Node Explorer
Users can freely surf in the Web2/Web3 world through Explorer, which is kernel compatible with Chrome. Also, a multi-page plug-in page function is provided. 

* Dapp Docking
A plug-in function is available in Primis, and all Dapps can be integrated into Primis.
Upgrade and confirm Dapps through the reliable link in the smart contract to ensure applications’ security. 


### Project Details


Primis is not only a single running node, but also a data relay network, and can also be used as a dapp client. Application can host the front-end on the Primis node, or connect the server interface to the Primis node. Application data is transmitted to the client or Primis terminal through a relay network composed of Primis nodes.

Primis's node browser can extend different dapp applications, and the server or backend program can host the traffic entry on smart contract, thus getting rid of the shackles of fixed servers. 

The network protocol that comes with the node can transmit data reliably and privately between different nodes. So that different services can be running in different ecosystems, including web sites, node browsers, DeFi application, GameFi entry, Social Network , etc. 

The wallet function that comes with Primis provides multi-chain asset management and transaction capabilities, so that most applications can be run on the Primis desktop in the form of plug-ins, so as to achieve one ecosystem and one desktop. Even the ability of multiple ecosystems to one desktop.
